### 1.1.1. Functions as first-class values

```csharp
Func<int, int> triple = x => x * 3;
var range = Enumerable.Range(1, 3);
var triples = range.Select(triple);
triples // => [3, 6, 9]
```

In this example, you start by declaring a function that returns the triple of a given integer and
assigning it to the variable triple. You then use Range to create an IEnumerable<int> with the
values [1, 2, 3]. 

You then invoke Select (an extension method on IEnumerable), giving it the
range and the triple function as arguments; this creates a new IEnumerable containing the
elements obtained by applying the triple function to each element in the input range.

### 1.1.2. Avoiding state mutation

```csharp
int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3 };
nums[0] = 7;
nums // => [7, 2, 3]
```

Such updates are also called destructive updates, because the value stored prior to the update is
destroyed. These should always be avoided when coding functionally. (Purely functional
languages donâ€™t allow in-place updates at all.)

Following this principle, sorting or filtering a list **should not modify the list in place but should
create a new, suitably filtered or sorted list without affecting the original**
